Notes
-----

- The simulation config file should only list date and vehicle location and viewpoint.
- There should be package configs listing scenery files and dlls.
- A programmatic record of which classes are active (if the user deselects some package).
- A status text along the bottom of the main window, and a progress bar for re-loading scenery.
